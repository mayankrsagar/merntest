## Approach & Trade-offs

* **Next.js** chosen for rapid setup, SSR capabilities, and file-based routing.
* **Tailwind CSS** for atomic styling and easy responsive utilities.
* **Framer Motion** for lightweight, declarative animations.
* **Trade-off**: Scoped each section into its own component, which increases file count but improves readability and reusability.

## Animations & Interactions

* Header fades in and nav links scale on hover.
* Hero section items stagger into view.
* Buttons include hover and tap feedback via Framer Motion.
